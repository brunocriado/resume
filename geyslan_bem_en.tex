\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{SLAE}: Security Linux Assembly Expert course assignments. All
  seven assignments accomplished with merit. This project gave birth to some of
  the smallest (and functional) shellcodes in the world. Smaller than those
  present in Metasploit. Eg. Tiny Shell Bind TCP and Shell Bind TCP Random Port
  (latter is unique).\newline
